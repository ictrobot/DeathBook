InventoryBook
============

When a player respawns, they are given a book containing a list of the items they died with. Since version 0.0.2, you can shift right click a book and quill to receive and inventory book for your current inventory, or shift right click a book and quill on a chest (or any tile entitiy which is an IInventory) to receive an inventory book for that block. There are also config options including requiring a book and quill to be present in your inventory when you die to receive a book and quill on respawn (If this is enabled, the book and quill is used up)

Since version 0.0.4, when playing multiplayer the mod is only needed on the server.

**MC 1.8.9, 1.9, 1.9.4, 1.10, 1.11.2 and 1.12**

The names of the items are displayed and you can hover over the name to view the full tooltip.

This works by embedding the NBT in the book. As there is a limit on book page length, items with large amounts of NBT may have there own page or the NBT may not be inclued.

The MC 1.9.4 jar works with MC 1.10.
