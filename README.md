InventoryBook
============

When a player respawns, they are given a book containing a list of the items they died with. Since version 0.0.2, you can shift right click a book and quill to receive and inventory book for your current inventory, or shift right click a book and quill on a chest (or any tile entitiy which is an IInventory) to receive an inventory book for that block. There are also config options including requiring a book and quill to be present in your inventory when you die to receive a book and quill on respawn (If this is enabled, the book and quill is used up)
